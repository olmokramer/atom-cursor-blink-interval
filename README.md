# cursor-blink-interval

Simple package that controls the cursor blinking interval. Set to `0` to disable cursor blinking (well... it will blink once every ~50 days).
Doesn't work in `mini` editors, except for disabling the blinking.

Try my other package, [block-cursor](https://atom.io/packages/block-cursor), for more cursor customization
